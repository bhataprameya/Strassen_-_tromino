# Strassen_&_tromino

 Strassen’s matrix multiplication algorithm: program takes  an input variable n > 0 in the Linux command line, generate two n*n random float matrices, A and B, and compute A * B using the Strassen’s matrix multiplication algorithm for the following two cases. To generate A and B, generate random float numbers that range between -5.0 and 5.0. For random float numbers consider two digits after decimal points (like 3.45)
(a)n=2^k where k is a positive integer.
(b)n != 2^k


Tromino tiling algorithm: Your program should take an input positive integer k and the position of the hole as the Linux command line and generate a 2^k * 2^k board.  For example ifyour input is 4 then your code should generate 16 x16 board
